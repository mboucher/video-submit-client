# Video Acquisition Submission Form

We need your help to improve our GenAI training models for Firefly! To do this, we’re requesting video submissions, and your permission to use content where you are shown in the content. All Adobe workers can participate, with the exception of Adobe workers residing in Illinois, Texas, China, Thailand, Hong Kong and Korea. Participation is entirely voluntary. Information about your participation (or lack thereof) will not be shared with your manager and will not adversely affect your employment in any way. 

**Data requested:** This is the Creative Brief for the content request: [Link to Creative Brief] 

**Who is requesting this data:** This request is coming from the DVA team to help improve Firefly models, including for LipSync (here is a demo from **[ProjectDubDubDub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZY-Cv1Q8NY)** from MAX 2023).  

**How the data will be used:**  The video (including audio) data will initially be used to improve, including test, the model for LipSync. The data may also be used to train other generative audio and video transcription models, as well as text-to-image, text-to-video, and text-to-audio generative models.  

Biometric Data will be used to train speaker and transcription models for generative visual and audio outputs. Please note the data will not be used to replicate your likeness (your face, voice, etc.).
